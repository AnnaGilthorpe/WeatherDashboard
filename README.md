# WeatherDashboard

Description

The aim of this challenge was to create a weather dashboard with form inputs. When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. 

Using the starter code I created an app that when a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:

    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed

When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity

When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

This build helped enhance my understanding and utilise APIs, javascript, Moment, Bootstrap, CSS and HTML code.

The finer details of what I have learnt include:-
<ul>
 <li>Fetch requests </li>
  <li>Utlising an API search </li>
  <li>Display the relevent data in a user friendly format</li>
  <li>Linking dates via Moment</li>

Technologies used:- MAC Terminal, VS Code and Git Hub.
